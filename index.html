        <h1>Meghan Alcida</h1>
        <p>In my freshman year, I spent most of my time drawing, whether it was a creative piece using many references put into
        one drawing, or just a simple drawing of one thing, I was playing drawing so much so other people noticed that I would
        draw so much and asked me why. One day, my art life changed forever when I drew a man and it was the most realistic
        drawing I had ever made and I was so proud of myself so I kept on drawing in that one style any time I felt like I
        wanted to draw and I created magnificent pieces. I drew cats, dogs, glasses of water, butterflies, people, anything I
        could think of I drew as long as I had a paper and pencil. I kept on at this for the rest of my years at Hamilton. Then,
        I came to Jefferson where I was finally given Drawing and painting 1 and my teacher just demonstrated one thing that
        clicked in my head that once again will change the way I draw objects and people forever, she made areas that had
        objects in front of them darker to make it seem as though they were 3d and next to eachother and that's when it all hit
        me, I always knew what it meant when people said darkness makes things seem like they have depth, but I've never really
        seen it. And ever since that I've applied it to every drawing I've done here so far and it's never failed ðŸ¥³</p>
